# Impact-Test

Objective:

The objective of this experiment was to analyze the impact toughness of AISI 1018 steel and AA6061-T6 aluminum across a range of temperatures, from 100°C to -196°C. This study aimed to investigate how temperature influences the energy absorption capacity of these materials during impact loading, particularly focusing on the ductile-to-brittle transition in steel. The results provide insight into material selection for applications subjected to extreme temperature conditions, such as aerospace, cryogenic storage, and structural engineering.
